## Propositions as Types: Curry-Howard Correspondence

[Outstanding talk by Philip Waldler at Strange Loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOiZatlZtGU) arguing that if you're using simply typed lambda calculus, and you're not using the fixed point operator (unlimited general recursion), then you're guarenteed it terminates. The halting problem becomes decidable.

- Propositions in logic correspond to types in a programming language.
- Proofs in the logic correspond to terms - to programs - in the programming language.
- Simplification of proofs corresponds to evaluation of programs.

According to Wadler, Lambda Calculus isn't invented, it's discovered. If aliens know modus ponens, they must also know lambda calculus.

The idea of garbage collection came around in the 50s and 60, but took 25 or 30 years to get broad adoption. It takes people a long time to come around to good ideas.
